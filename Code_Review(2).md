On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:

This program is well documented. Although some of aspects of the tic tac toe game are unclear, I could see that it was written properly and just needs some more work. While playing the game, it was difficult to keep track of the moves made, but when I made note on my own, it seemed to be able to determine who ends up winning. Also more games are stated in the readme, but not present in the folder.
