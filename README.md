# GrandMasterArcade
Multi-Threading Program w/ Text Based Games


Grand Master Arcade: Arcade for the Masters

Plan is to utilize multithreading and create multiple threads for the clients connecting to the Master's server as well as threads for the individual games themselves. (As of now)
    - TicTacToe
    - War
    - Battleship

**Essentially each game will have an array where the clients are added to, to manage the clients**
TicTacToe will consist of:

    - Two clients connecting to the server to begin the game
    - Clients will take turns playing marking spots on the grid.
    - Once game finishes, will prompt user if they want to play again or switch to another game.
War will consist of:

    - Two clients playing war --> highest card wins, nice and simple
    - First player to run out of cards, loses/
    - Once game finishes, will prompt user if they want to play again or switch to another game.
